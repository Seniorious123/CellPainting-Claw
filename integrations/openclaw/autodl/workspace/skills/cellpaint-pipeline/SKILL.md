# Cell Painting Pipeline

Use this skill when the user wants to discover, run, or summarize the standardized Cell Painting workflow library.

## Goal

Translate natural-language requests into the current documented skills rather than custom shell chains or older compatibility aliases.

## Preferred CLI

```bash
$PYTHON_BIN -m cellpainting_skills
```

## Preferred order

1. Discovery

```bash
$PYTHON_BIN -m cellpainting_skills list
$PYTHON_BIN -m cellpainting_skills describe --skill <skill-key>
```

2. Skill execution

```bash
cd $REPO_ROOT
$PYTHON_BIN -m cellpainting_skills run \
  --config $REPO_ROOT/configs/project_config.example.json \
  --skill <skill-key> \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

3. Use `cellpainting_claw` only when the user explicitly needs a lower-level or broader interface

```bash
$PYTHON_BIN -m cellpainting_claw <command> ...
```

## Current skill examples

Segmentation:

- `cp-prepare-segmentation-inputs`
- `cp-extract-segmentation-artifacts`
- `cp-generate-segmentation-previews`

Classical profiling:

- `cp-extract-measurements`
- `cp-build-single-cell-table`
- `cyto-aggregate-profiles`
- `cyto-annotate-profiles`
- `cyto-normalize-profiles`
- `cyto-select-profile-features`
- `cyto-summarize-classical-profiles`

Deep features:

- `dp-export-deep-feature-inputs`
- `dp-build-deep-feature-project`
- `dp-run-deep-feature-model`
- `dp-collect-deep-features`
- `dp-summarize-deep-features`

Data access:

- `data-inspect-availability`
- `data-plan-download`
- `data-download`

## Routing guidance

Prefer the fine-grained public skill that directly matches the user's task.

Examples:

- if the user wants the segmentation load-data table, choose `cp-prepare-segmentation-inputs`
- if the user wants masks, labels, outlines, or segmentation tables, choose `cp-extract-segmentation-artifacts`
- if the user wants quick visual checks, choose `cp-generate-segmentation-previews`

Do not default to older high-level compatibility names such as `run-segmentation`, `run-classical-profiling`, or `run-deepprofiler` unless the user explicitly asks for those legacy workflow aliases.

## Reporting expectations

For each run, report:

- exact skill key used
- exact command used
- config path
- output directory
- the main files or directories written
- the next likely skill when the task naturally leads to another step

## Working directory rule

Run CellPainting skill commands from `$REPO_ROOT`.

This matters because the demo and example configs resolve backend data paths relative to the repository layout. If the current shell is inside the OpenClaw workspace, prepend `cd $REPO_ROOT` before running the skill command.

## Optional MCP route

If the host is configured to use MCP, start the server with:

```bash
$REPO_ROOT/integrations/openclaw/start_cellpaint_mcp_http.sh
```

Then prefer MCP discovery only to decide which current skill to run. The actual task should still be framed around the same fine-grained public skill catalog.

## Config guidance

Treat the project config as the source of truth for:

- backend roots
- workspace and output roots
- selected `.cppipe` templates
- runtime settings

Do not invent paths or template names when the config can provide them.
